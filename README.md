## 🚀 Installation

1. Go to your Jellyfin **Dashboard** → **General**.
2. Scroll down to **Custom CSS**.
3. Add the following:
   ```css
   @import url('https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/safiyu/ijelly@1/ijelly.css');
   ```
4. Click **Save**.
5. Go to **Settings** → **Display** and enable **Backdrops**.

The `@1` pin tracks the latest `1.x` release tag, so you get fixes without an untested version landing on your server the moment it's pushed. See [Releases](../../releases) for the changelog.

## 🎨 Customising

ijelly exposes its design tokens as CSS custom properties on `:root`. Override any of them in your own Custom CSS block, after the `@import`, to retheme without editing the file:

| Variable | Default | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `--apple-bg` | `#000` | Base page background |
| `--apple-glass` | `rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1)` | Light glass fill |
| `--apple-glass-heavy` | `rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.2)` | Heavier glass fill |
| `--apple-text` | `#ffffff` | Primary text color |
| `--apple-text-dim` | `rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.6)` | Secondary/inactive text |
| `--apple-accent` | `#007aff` | Focus rings, active states |
| `--apple-radius` | `12px` | Standard corner radius |
| `--apple-radius-large` | `20px` | Large corner radius (TV cards) |
| `--apple-blur` | `blur(25px) saturate(180%)` | Backdrop blur intensity |
| `--apple-shadow` | see `ijelly.css` | Card hover shadow |
| `--apple-font` | system font stack | Base typeface |
| `--apple-spring-fast` | `cubic-bezier(0.16, 1, 0.3, 1)` | Quick UI transitions |
| `--apple-spring-bouncy` | `cubic-bezier(0.34, 1.56, 0.64, 1)` | Card hover/zoom transitions |

Example — swap the accent color:
```css
:root {
    --apple-accent: #ff375f;
}
```

## ✅ Compatibility

- **Tested against:** Jellyfin Web (current stable release), desktop Chrome/Firefox/Safari, and the Samsung Tizen TV app.
- **Subtitle repositioning** while the on-screen display is visible relies on the CSS `:has()` selector (Chrome/Edge 105+, Safari 15.4+, Firefox 121+). Older browsers, including some pre-2023 Tizen firmware, will keep subtitles at their default position instead of shifting them — playback and readability are unaffected.
- **Mobile/tablet** (≤1000px width) automatically reduces or disables backdrop blur to avoid GPU-related UI stalls on lower-powered devices.
- Uses the OS/browser's system font stack — no external font requests are made, so the theme works on offline or LAN-only servers.
